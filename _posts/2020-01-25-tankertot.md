## Introduction
This project started late August 2019 as part of a semester project for CS 329E
Elements of Game Development at The University of Texas at Austin. We formed in teams of
three tasked with creating a web-based video game from scratch by using the Phaser
3 game engine which we all had no experience with prior to the course.

We originally had to pitch an idea to the professor and TA, so after brainstorming
and original rejection of a top-down dungeon crawler we settled on a physics based
puzzle shooter game designed around a tank riding Corgi went to battle with squirrels.
We got the idea after the professor's love of tanks and the TA's pet Corgi taterTot,
thus we named the game tankerTot. tankerTot is available to be played online at:
