## Introduction
This project started mid September 2019 as part of a semester project for CS 327E
Elements of Databases at The University of Texas at Austin. We formed in teams of
two tasked with browsing through publicly available datasets and picking two do cross-data
tables and analysis.

For our main dataset my partner and I chose the national storm events dataset by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), found [here](https://public.enigma.com/browse/collection/national-climatic-weather-center-storm-events/3d0d8bdf-b885-48b9-a3b1-8a8441fc0131).
And we chose to cross it with the National Fire Incident Reporting System
of the U.S Government's Federal Emergency Management Agency, found [here](https://public.enigma.com/browse/collection/nfirs-wild-land-incidents/952d1599-65cc-4374-afa8-b07f6cdb2f98). Our goal was to see how
storm events and wildfires compare when considering the time of year, location, and
damage caused.
