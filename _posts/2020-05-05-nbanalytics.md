## Introduction
This project started mid February 2020 as part of a semester project for CS 331E
Elements of Software Engineering II at The University of Texas at Austin. We formed
a team of six students and discussed what we wanted to accomplish, ultimately settling
on a shared love for sports leading to our NBA analytics website.

The website was to be hosted on Google Cloud Platform and was set to be completed
by the end of the semester, in early May. We used Agile development methodology to
prioritize tasks of importance with user stories. To accomplish our goals within
the time we used multiple common practice tools.

Here is a link to our website, however it may be down due to rising cost to host
on GCP. ([NBAnalytics](http://nbanalytics.me/)) Otherwise here is a link to the
GitLab repository:[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/Basilio0505/cs331e-group-project)
