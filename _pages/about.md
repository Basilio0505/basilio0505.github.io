I am a recent grad and aspiring software engineer. I specialize in software design,
and data science. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Arts and Entertainment
technologies and a Certificate in Elements of Computing from The University of Texas
at Austin.

I am strong in **Python**, **Javascript**, **SQL**, **C#**, **C++**,
and **HTML/CSS** coding languages. I have experience in working with tools such as
**Google Cloud Platform**, **postgreSQL**, **git bash**, **Unity Game Engine**, **Phaser 3**,
**Bootstrap**, **Docker**, and **Jupyter Notebook**.

A little more about me, I was born and raised in the Rio Grande Valley, Texas and
graduated among the top of my class and was privileged to be able to attend The University
of Texas and move to Austin. Some of the things I enjoy doing are running and swimming
to keep active, exploring other culture's foods (especially asian), watching  football anime
and wrestling shows. I enjoy playing video games with my favorite genre being open-world
action RPG games. I also enjoy listening to all types of music, except country no
thanks, but mostly I listen to hip-hop and Kpop (weird combo?). I tend to think of
myself the best of both worlds of a sports and hip-hop bro and a total weeb and gamer
on the other side. Anyways I'm a pretty chill guy, I can be quiet at first but I
warm up quickly. For anything whether working or regularly I tend to be very focused
and dedicated to my passions.

I have previous internship experience from my time working as a game designer for
the [Simulation and Game Applications Lab](https://sagalab.utexas.edu/) at The University
of Texas at Austin. Where my role involved brainstorming and researching making a
video game designed to be shown to middle school teachers in the Austin, TX area.
I was challenged with designing a game mainly to point out underlying implicit racial
biases that exist in the education system, mostly towards young African American
students, but the game was to be disguised as a regular classroom management style
game to not influence the teachers decisions. I enjoyed my time working with the
writing team on crafting perfect scenarios and consulted with a board of African
American professors and graduate students at The University of Texas to assure we
handled the sensitive topic with care.
